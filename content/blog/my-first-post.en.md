## Foreword

If you are reading this blog, thank you because you are one of my first readers.
If you're here because someone spammed it to you, that means I'm famous, woo.

And nothing (two words used when you don't know how to start), I decided to try writing technical and non-technical articles and see what happens a bit. Please don't hate me when I make mistakes though, rather write to me so I can correct and improve (my contact information is all in the [home](/en)).

As I went around the web and read articles of various kinds, a desire arose in me to share content about problems with solutions I found or just write my idea or my thoughts about something in general.
Of course, the next step was:
>Why should a person follow and read my blog?

In all honesty, I still couldn't come up with an answer, just another question:
>What's stopping me from doing that?

and so I said to myself:

>I do it.

## What technologies I used and why.

I love backend development, a little less frontend development (if you don't know the differences see [here](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_e_back-end)).

In my case it means that I'm not interested in giving custom graphics to this blog, but I want to focus on content. That's why I opted for a static site generator, to be precise I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme.

I have the ability to write this article in simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) using different tools such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or the newly born [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), do a commit with my beloved [git](https://git-scm.com/), push to the remote repository (in this case [GitHub](https://github.com/)) and off with the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that makes my content online and available on the fly.

I decided not to use Wordpress, which by the way I know how to use and is simple anyway.

Having a static site allows me to have maximum performance without minimal effort (at the moment) plus by choosing the right theme search engine optimization is included.

I will be using the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) until I have exceeded the [usage limits](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits) and in case in the future I may move all this content (which will maybe stop at this article) to another hosting service without limits.

## Blog features. 

Here are the cool features of this static blog:
- **Multilingual**: I will try to write each article in Italian and English.
- **Dark and Light Theme**: the default is obviously dark, according to your preference you can change it in the top left corner.
- **Search**: at the top right search for a [keyword](https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/keyword) and find the articles you are interested in.
- **Beautiful**: I like it.

## Conclusion.

As you may have noticed, I get excited with little. For these kinds of things that are simple and found by chance in my continuous search I use my favorite word which is [serendipity](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipit%C3%A0). 

Regarding content, however, I plan to write both computer-themed and non-computer-themed articles. They will all be properly categorized and tagged, so it will be easier to find them again. I will try to put to the less common words a link with the meaning so that every kind of person can understand everything thoroughly.

Whatever, let's star
